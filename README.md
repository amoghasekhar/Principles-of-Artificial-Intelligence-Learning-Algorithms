# Principles of Artificial Intelligence Learning Algorithms

This repo contains source code of all 3 projects.

## Homework 1 [Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/Principles-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/PA1-Prototype%20selection%20for%20nearest%20neighbor)

Used two prototype selection methods. 

The first one is that find M nearest points around each center of 10
digit classes which called K Nearest Centers method. 

The second one is Condensed Nearest Neighbors algorithm which uses one nearest
neighbor rule to iteratively decide if a sample should be removed or not.

## Homework 2 [Coordinate Descent](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/Principles-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/PA2-Coordinate%20descent)

The main idea of the coordinate descent algorithm is to update the coordinate which has the maximal absolute value of gradient in every epoch.

## Homework 3 [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/Principles-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/PA3-Word%20embeddings)

Generated word embedding vectors from brown textbook in nltk pcackage which is based on word relationship and frequency. 

Implemented dimension reduction using PCA. Then applied K-means and KNN with pre-computed cosine distance to evaulate result.
